# Metrics Reference

Pipelock exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics` on the proxy listen port
(default 8888). All metric names are prefixed with `pipelock_`.

## Scrape Configuration

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: pipelock
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["pipelock:8888"]
```

For Kubernetes deployments using a PodMonitor:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: pipelock
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pipelock
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - port: metrics
      path: /metrics
      interval: 30s
```

## HTTP Request Metrics

These track plain HTTP requests flowing through the proxy. HTTPS traffic
uses CONNECT tunnels (see below) and does not increment request counters.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_requests_total` | counter | `result`, `agent` | Total HTTP requests. `result` is `allowed` or `blocked`. `agent` is the agent *profile* name (matched against the `agents` config section), not the raw `X-Pipelock-Agent` header — bounded cardinality for Prometheus. Unknown/unmatched agents fall to `_default`. For per-request raw agent identity, read the `actor` field on signed receipts. |
| `pipelock_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | (none) | HTTP request latency. Buckets: 10ms to 10s. |
| `pipelock_scanner_hits_total` | counter | `scanner`, `agent` | Blocks by scanner type (e.g. `dlp`, `prompt_injection`, `domain`). `agent` follows the same profile-mapping rule as `pipelock_requests_total`. |

## CONNECT Tunnel Metrics

In forward-proxy mode, HTTPS traffic uses CONNECT tunnels, which are opaque TCP
pipes that pipelock cannot inspect beyond the hostname. These are the primary
traffic metrics for forward-proxy deployments.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_tunnels_total` | counter | `result`, `agent` | Total CONNECT tunnels. `result` is `completed` or `blocked`. |
| `pipelock_tunnel_duration_seconds` | histogram | (none) | Tunnel lifetime. Buckets: 1s to 300s. |
| `pipelock_tunnel_bytes_total` | counter | (none) | Total bytes transferred through all tunnels. |
| `pipelock_active_tunnels` | gauge | (none) | Currently open CONNECT tunnels. |
| `pipelock_sni_total` | counter | `category`, `agent` | SNI verification results. `category` is `match`, `mismatch`, `not_tls`, `no_extension`, `malformed_tls`, or `timeout`. |

## TLS Interception Metrics

When `tls_interception.enabled` is true, pipelock performs TLS MITM on
CONNECT tunnels and records additional metrics for interception outcomes,
handshake latency, and per-request/response blocking.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_tls_intercept_total` | counter | `outcome` | Total TLS-intercepted CONNECT tunnels. `outcome` is `intercepted` or `handshake_error`. |
| `pipelock_tls_handshake_duration_seconds` | histogram | `side` | TLS handshake latency. `side` is `client` or `upstream`. Buckets: 1ms to 500ms. |
| `pipelock_tls_request_blocked_total` | counter | `reason` | Requests blocked inside intercepted tunnels. `reason` is `authority_mismatch`, `body_dlp`, `body_prompt_injection`, or `header_dlp`. |
| `pipelock_tls_response_blocked_total` | counter | `reason` | Responses blocked inside intercepted tunnels. `reason` is `compressed`, `read_error`, `oversized`, or `injection`. |
| `pipelock_tls_cert_cache_size` | gauge | (none) | Current number of cached forged leaf certificates. |

## Request Scanning Metrics

Request body and header scanning detects secrets and prompt injection in POST/PUT/PATCH bodies,
form data, multipart uploads, and HTTP headers on forward-proxy traffic.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_body_dlp_hits_total` | counter | `action`, `agent` | Request body DLP detections. `action` is `warn` or `block`. |
| `pipelock_body_prompt_injection_hits_total` | counter | `action`, `agent` | Request body prompt-injection detections. `action` is `warn` or `block`. |
| `pipelock_header_dlp_hits_total` | counter | `action`, `agent` | Request header DLP detections. `action` is `warn` or `block`. |
| `pipelock_response_scan_exempt_total` | counter | `reason`, `transport` | Response scanning exemptions. `reason` is `exempt_domain` or `suppress`; current emitters use transports such as `fetch`, `forward`, `connect`, `reverse`, and `websocket`. Every skipped response scan is counted so operators can quantify how much traffic bypasses injection scanning. |

## WebSocket Proxy Metrics

WebSocket connections are upgraded from CONNECT tunnels when the target
matches a known WebSocket API host. Unlike opaque tunnels, pipelock can
inspect WebSocket frames for DLP and prompt injection.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_ws_connections_total` | counter | `result` | Total WebSocket connections. `result` is `completed` or `blocked`. |
| `pipelock_ws_duration_seconds` | histogram | (none) | WebSocket connection lifetime. Buckets: 1s to 3600s. |
| `pipelock_ws_bytes_total` | counter | `direction` | Bytes transferred. `direction` is `client_to_server` or `server_to_client`. |
| `pipelock_ws_active_connections` | gauge | (none) | Currently open WebSocket connections. |
| `pipelock_ws_frames_total` | counter | `type` | Frames by type (e.g. `text`, `binary`). |
| `pipelock_ws_scan_hits_total` | counter | `scanner` | WebSocket frame scan detections by scanner. |
| `pipelock_forward_ws_redirect_hint_total` | counter | (none) | CONNECT requests to known WebSocket API hosts (potential upgrade candidates). |

## Build Information

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_info` | gauge | `version` | Build information. Always 1. The `version` label identifies the running release (e.g. `2.2.0`). |
| `pipelock_kill_switch_active` | gauge | `source` | Whether each kill switch source is active (1) or inactive (0). `source` is `config`, `api`, `signal`, or `sentinel`. Reported fresh on every scrape. |

## Security Event Metrics

These counters track enforcement actions. In a healthy deployment, all of
these should be zero or very low. Any sustained increase warrants
investigation.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_kill_switch_denials_total` | counter | `transport`, `endpoint` | Requests denied by the kill switch. |
| `pipelock_chain_detections_total` | counter | `pattern`, `severity`, `action` | Tool call chain pattern detections. |

## Session Profiling Metrics

Pipelock tracks per-session behavioral profiles. Sessions that deviate
from established patterns trigger anomalies and escalation events. Adaptive
enforcement can upgrade later requests based on that session state, so these
metrics are both observability and enforcement context.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_session_anomalies_total` | counter | `type` | Behavioral anomalies by type. |
| `pipelock_session_escalations_total` | counter | `from`, `to` | Escalation events by session enforcement level transition (e.g. `elevated` → `high`, `high` → `critical`). These transitions feed adaptive enforcement decisions on later requests. |
| `pipelock_sessions_active` | gauge | (none) | Currently tracked sessions. |
| `pipelock_sessions_evicted_total` | counter | (none) | Sessions evicted by TTL or capacity limit. |
| `pipelock_adaptive_sessions_current` | gauge | `level` | Currently escalated sessions by enforcement level. |
| `pipelock_session_auto_deescalation_total` | counter | `from`, `to` | Autonomous time-based session de-escalations. |

## Cross-Request Detection Metrics

Cross-request detection tracks secrets split across multiple requests
using entropy budgets and fragment reassembly. These metrics indicate
active exfiltration attempts.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_cross_request_entropy_exceeded_total` | counter | (none) | Entropy budget exceeded events. |
| `pipelock_cross_request_dlp_match_total` | counter | (none) | Fragment reassembly DLP match events. |
| `pipelock_cross_request_fragment_buffer_bytes` | gauge | (none) | Total fragment buffer memory across all sessions. |

## Scan API Metrics

The Scan API (`/api/v1/scan`) is an evaluation-plane endpoint for external
integrations. Disabled by default; set `scan_api.listen` to enable.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_scan_api_requests_total` | counter | `kind`, `decision`, `status_code` | Total scan API requests. |
| `pipelock_scan_api_duration_seconds` | histogram | `kind` | Scan API latency. Default Prometheus buckets. |
| `pipelock_scan_api_findings_total` | counter | `kind`, `scanner`, `severity` | Scan API findings by scanner and severity. |
| `pipelock_scan_api_errors_total` | counter | `kind`, `error_code` | Scan API errors by kind and error code. |
| `pipelock_scan_api_inflight_requests` | gauge | (none) | Current number of in-flight scan API requests. |

## Address Protection Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_address_findings_total` | counter | `chain`, `verdict` | Address poisoning findings by blockchain and verdict. |

## File Sentry Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_file_sentry_findings_total` | counter | `pattern`, `severity`, `agent` | Secrets detected in agent-written files. |

## Adaptive Enforcement Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_adaptive_upgrades_total` | counter | `from_action`, `to_action`, `level` | Requests where adaptive enforcement upgraded the action (e.g. warn to block). |

## Airlock Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_airlock_sessions` | gauge | `tier` | Current sessions in each airlock tier. |
| `pipelock_airlock_transitions_total` | counter | `from`, `to`, `trigger` | Airlock tier transitions. |
| `pipelock_airlock_denials_total` | counter | `tier`, `transport`, `action_class` | Requests denied by airlock enforcement. `action_class` is the transport-provided action label such as `read`, `GET`, `POST`, or `CONNECT`. |
| `pipelock_airlock_drain_completed_total` | counter | (none) | Sessions that completed drain cleanly. |
| `pipelock_airlock_drain_timeout_total` | counter | (none) | Sessions whose drain timed out before in-flight work completed. |

| `pipelock_shield_latency_seconds` | histogram | `transport` | Browser shield latency. |

## Reverse Proxy Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_reverse_proxy_requests_total` | counter | `method`, `status` | Total reverse proxy requests by method and status. |
| `pipelock_reverse_proxy_scan_blocked_total` | counter | `direction`, `reason` | Reverse proxy requests blocked by scanning. |

## Capture System Metrics

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `pipelock_capture_dropped_total` | counter | (none) | Capture entries dropped due to queue overflow. |

## Counter Initialization

Prometheus `CounterVec` metrics only appear in `/metrics` output after
their first increment. If you see a metric missing from a fresh instance,
it means that event type hasn't occurred yet, not that the metric is
broken. For example, `pipelock_requests_total` won't appear if all traffic
is HTTPS (CONNECT tunnels).

## JSON Stats Endpoint

Pipelock also exposes a JSON summary at `/stats` on the same port. This
provides a human-readable snapshot without needing Prometheus:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/stats | jq .
```

```json
{
  "uptime_seconds": 3600.5,
  "requests": {
    "total": 42,
    "allowed": 40,
    "blocked": 2,
    "block_rate": 0.0476
  },
  "tunnels": 1523,
  "websockets": 0,
  "top_blocked_domains": [
    {"name": "evil.com", "count": 2}
  ],
  "top_scanners": [
    {"name": "dlp", "count": 2}
  ],
  "sessions": {
    "active": 3,
    "anomalies": 0,
    "escalations": 0,
    "top_anomalies": []
  },
  "agents": {
    "claude-code": {"allowed": 35, "blocked": 1, "tunnels": 1200},
    "cursor": {"allowed": 5, "blocked": 1, "tunnels": 323}
  }
}
```

The `agents` field is omitted when no agent-scoped traffic has been recorded. Fresh deployments or single-profile setups without agent configuration will not include this key.

## Grafana Dashboard

An importable Grafana dashboard is included at
[`configs/grafana-dashboard.json`](../configs/grafana-dashboard.json).
Import it via **Dashboards → Import → Upload JSON file** in Grafana.

The bundled dashboard focuses on the core traffic, TLS interception, security
event, WebSocket, adaptive enforcement, and Scan API panels. Newer metric
families such as airlock and browser shield are exposed in Prometheus even if
you add your own panels for them.

## Alert Rules

Example Prometheus alert rules are available at
[`examples/prometheus/pipelock-alerts.yaml`](../examples/prometheus/pipelock-alerts.yaml).
See the [SIEM Integration Guide](guides/siem-integration.md) for
Alertmanager routing and automated response patterns.
